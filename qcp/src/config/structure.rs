/// ## tl;dr
///
/// For good performance, at the very least, configure:
/// * [rx](Configuration#structfield.rx); and
/// * [tx](Configuration#structfield.tx) if it is significantly different from rx.
///
/// ### Configuration files
///
/// These fields may be specified in any order. In configuration files, the field names are case insensitive and we
/// ignore hyphens or underscores.
/// In other words, you can use upper case, lower case, camel case, mixed case, shouty snake case, kebab case, train case, whatever you like.
///
/// [More details about the configuration mechanism](crate::config).
///
/// ### Command line
///
/// All configurable options may be used on the command line. There, they must be specified in kebab-case.
///
/// ### Developer notes
/// There is no `default()`.
/// You can access qcp's hard-wired configuration defaults through [`Configuration::system_default()`].
///
/// This structure uses the [Optionalify](derive_deftly_template_Optionalify) deftly macro to automatically
/// define the `Configuration_Optional` struct, which is the same but has all members of type `Option<whatever>`.
/// This is the magic that lets us use the same underlying struct for CLI and saved configuration files:
/// the CLI uses the `_Optional` version , with everything defaulting to `None`.
/// The result is that wherever the user does not provide a value, values read from lower priority sources
/// (configuration files and system defaults) obtain.
///
// Maintainer note: None of the members of this struct should be Option<anything>. That leads to sunspots in the CLI and strange warts (Some(Some(foo))).
