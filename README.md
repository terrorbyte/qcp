The QUIC Copier (`qcp`) is an experimental
high-performance remote file copy utility for long-distance internet connections.

## 📋 Features

- 🔧 Drop-in replacement for `scp`
- 🛡️ Similar security to `scp`, using existing, well-known mechanisms
- 🚀 Better throughput on congested networks
- **(New in 0.2)** Configuration file support

For a full list of changes, see the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

#### Platform support status

- Well tested: Debian and Ubuntu on x86_64, using OpenSSH
- Tested: Ubuntu on WSL; aarch64 (Raspbian)
- Untested: OSX/BSD family
- Not currently supported: Windows

## 🧰 Getting Started

* You must have ssh access to the target machine.
  - You must be able to exchange UDP packets with the target on a given port.
  - If the local machine is behind connection-tracking NAT, things usually work just fine. This is the case for the vast majority of home and business network connections.
  - You can tell qcp to use a particular port range if you need to.
* Install the `qcp` binary on both machines. It needs to be in your `PATH` on the remote machine.
* Run `qcp --help-buffers` and follow its instructions.

### Installing pre-built binaries

These can be found on the [latest release](https://github.com/crazyscot/qcp/releases/latest).

* Debian/Ubuntu packages are provided.
* For other Linux x86_64: Use x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz
* For other Linux aarch64: Use aarch64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz

The binaries are statically linked. Linux builds should work on all recent distributions, as long as you have selected the correct CPU architecture.

### Installation from source

Prerequisite: You need to have `capnpc` installed. Your distribution likely packages this, or see https://capnproto.org/.

You can install the package from source using `cargo`:

```bash
cargo install --locked qcp
```

#### If you are new to Rust and don't have the tools installed

* Install the `rustup` tool via your package manager, or see [Rust installation](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
* `rustup toolchain install stable`
* Proceed as above

## ⚙️ Usage

The basic syntax is the same as scp or rcp.

```
qcp [OPTIONS] <SOURCE> <DESTINATION>
```

The program has a comprehensive help message, accessed via `qcp -h` (brief) or `qcp --help` (long form).

For example:

```bash
$ qcp my-server:/tmp/testfile /tmp/
⠂ Transferring data                                                           2.1MB/s (last 1s)
testfile ████████████████████████████████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ 1s @ 6.71 MB/s [10.49 MB]
```

Things you should know:

* **qcp uses the ssh binary on your system to connect to the target machine**.
ssh will check the remote host key and prompt you for a password or passphrase in the usual way.

* **qcp will read your ssh config file** to resolve any Hostname aliases you may have defined there.
The idea is, if you can `ssh` to a host, you should also be able to `qcp` to it.
However, some particularly complicated ssh config files may be too much for qcp to understand.
(In particular, `Match` directives are not currently supported.)
In that case, you can use `--ssh-config` to provide an alternative configuration (or set it in your qcp configuration file).

#### Tuning

By default qcp is tuned for a 100Mbit connection, with 300ms round-trip time to the target server.

Various network tuning options are available.

For example, if you have 300Mbit/s (37.5MB/s) download and 100Mbit/s (12.5MB/s) upload, you might use these options:

```bash
qcp my-server:/tmp/testfile /tmp/ --rx 37M --tx 12M
```

Performance tuning can be a tricky subject. See the [performance] documentation.

#### Persistent configuration

The useful options -- those you might want to use regularly including `rx`, `tx` and `rtt` -- can be specified
in a configuration file. See [config] for details.

## 📖 How qcp works

The brief version:

1. We ssh to the remote machine and run `qcp --server` there
1. Both sides generate a TLS key and exchange self-signed certs over the ssh pipe between them
1. We use those certs to set up a QUIC session between the two
1. We transfer files over QUIC

The [protocol] documentation contains more detail and a discussion of its security properties.

## 📘 Project Policies

### ⚖️ License

This project is released publicly under the [GNU Affero General Public License](LICENSE).

Alternative license terms can be made available on request on a commercial basis (see below).

### 🧑‍🏭 Bugs, Features & Contributions

Bug reports and feature requests are welcome, please use the [issue] tracker.

- It may be useful to check the [issues list] and the [discussions] first in case somebody else has already raised it.
- Please be aware that I mostly work on this project in my own time.

🚧 If you're thinking of contributing code, please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

#### Help wanted: MacOS/BSD

I'd particularly welcome performance reports from MacOS/BSD users as those are not platforms I use regularly.

### 📑 Version number and compatibility

This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) 2.0.0.

In its initial experimental phase, the major number will be kept at 0.
Breaking changes will be noted in the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) and will trigger a minor version bump.

The project will move to version 1.x when the protocol has stabilised. After 1.0, breaking changes will trigger a major version bump.

## 💸 Supporting the project

If you find this software useful and would like to say thank you, please consider [buying me a coffee] or [ko-fi]. [Github sponsorship] is also available.

Please also consider supporting the galaxy of projects this work builds upon.
Most notably, [Quinn] is a pure-Rust implementation of the [QUIC] protocol, without which qcp simply wouldn't exist in its current form.

If you're a business and need a formal invoice for your accountant, my freelancing company can issue the paperwork.
For this, and any other commercial enquiries please get in touch, to `qcp@crazyscot.com`. We would be pleased to discuss commercial terms for:

* Alternative licensing
* Support
* Sponsoring feature development

## 💡 Future Directions

Some ideas for the future, in no particular order:

* Support for copying multiple files (e.g. shell globs or `scp -r`)
* Windows native support
* Firewall/NAT traversal
* Interactive file transfer (akin to `ftp`)
* Smart file copy using the `rsync` protocol or similar (send only the sections you need to)
* Graphical interface for ftp mode
* Review the protocol and perhaps pivot to using capnp RPC
* Bind a daemon to a fixed port, for better firewall/NAT traversal properties but at the cost of having to implement user authentication.
* _The same thing we do every night, Pinky. We try to take over the world!_
