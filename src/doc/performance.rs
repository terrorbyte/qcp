//! # 🚀 Performance tuning
//!
//! There's probably a whole book to be written about this.
//!
//! I've spent some time tuning this for my use case and leave some hooks so you can experiment.
//!
//! **It is critical to understand that the Internet is a strange place with many variables, which will likely confound any experiment you may try.**
//!
//! In my experience, long-distance traffic flows vary wildly from second to second.
//! This is why I added a near-instant (last 1s) bandwidth readout, as well the average.
//!
//! I found that the throughput from my build server (data flow from Europe to NZ) is sometimes very
//! fast, able to saturate my 300Mbit last-mile downlink, and sometimes falls back to hundreds of
//! kilobits or even worse. But the way QUIC applies congestion control worked around this really well.
//! Throughput accelerates rapidly when congestion clears; I _think_ this is subjectively much faster than scp does, but I've not yet gathered the data to do a proper statistical analysis.
//!
//! Yes, it's inefficient to do an ssh handshake and then a QUIC/TLS handshake.
//! But the cost of doing so isn't much in absolute terms (sometimes a few seconds),
//! and this amortises nicely over a large file transfer.
//!
//! ### Tips
//!
//! * When qcp tells you to set up the kernel UDP buffers, do so; they really make a difference. **You need to do this on both machines.**
//! * Run `qcp -h` and study the network tuning options available to you.
//!   * With bandwidth and RTT - at least on my network conditions - I've found that perfect accuracy of configuration isn't so important, as long as it's in the right ballpark.
//!     * In many cases your _last-mile_ bandwidth, i.e. whatever you're paying your ISP for,
//!       is a good setting to use.
//!       But there's a trap here: ISPs often describe their packages in bits per second,
//!       but qcp expects a configuration in bytes!
//!   * Try out `--congestion bbr` if you like. Sometimes it helps.
//!     But understand that it remains experimental, and it does send out a lot more packets.
//!     _If you have a metered connection, this may be an issue!_
//!     [More about BBR](https://github.com/google/bbr/blob/master/Documentation/bbr-faq.md).
//!   * Mess with the initial congestion window if you like, but I didn't find it reliably useful.
//! * Watch out for either end becoming CPU bound. One of my test machines on my local LAN was unable to move more than 7MB/s. It turned out that its CPU was so old it didn't have a useful crypto accelerator. If that applies to you, unfortunately you're not going to be able to move data any faster without a hardware upgrade.
//! * If you want to copy multiple files to/from the same remote machine, ssh connection multiplexing will save you a few seconds for each. (You can visualise the difference with the `--profile` option.)
//! * The `--debug` option will report additional information that might help you diagnose configuration issues.
//!
//! qcp will report the number of congestion events it detected, unless you run in `-q` mode.
//!
//! You might find it useful to run in `--stats` mode for additional insights; here's the output from a typical run:
//!
//! ```log

//! ```
//!
//! (This was with a 100MB test file, which isn't always enough for the protocol to get fully up to speed.)
